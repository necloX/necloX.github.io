I believe proof assistants are the most important things happening in the world of mathematics. Programming languages and their implementations play a central role in this endeavor. Regarding practices, goals, and preferences, mathematicians arrive pretty late to the party. 

Programming languages have evolved according to the needs of their original users (programmers), which are primarily runtime focused. Some concerns, like code readability or maintainability, are shared. However, one might expect that the goal of proving, verifying, and discovering theorems will entail some specific needs. 

However, programming languages, and among them proof assistants, are designed and implemented by CS people. To make sure that the inputs of mathematicians are as efficient as possible, it would be great if mathematicians had a basic knowledge of how these systems work behind the scene. 

In this blog, I will document what I learn along this journey in the world of programming languages and their implementations. So far, I would say that the first thing I learned was that there is way more PL design in doing maths that one mmight think !
